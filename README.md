## zeroing script
The zerioing script takes in a spreadsheet output by the Ussing chamber containing a 'raw data' and 'protocol' tab. The script zeroes these data to the level portion before each drug was added and outputs to a new excel sheet. It also generates a tab with the maximum/minimum values for each drug.
